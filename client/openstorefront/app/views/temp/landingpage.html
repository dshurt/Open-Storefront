    <span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px">PURPOSE: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Program Executive Office - Information Assurance/NetOps (PEO-IAN), is conducting this Request for Information (RFI) as market research to determine sources with CORE competencies and demonstrated experience in conducting experiments, pilots, and participating in exercises to demonstrate Identity and Access Management (IdAM) technical capabilities and product performance with regards to management of user authorizations, e.g. Privilege Management. Areas of focus will include development of a Privilege Management strategy for the DoD and evaluation and integration of implementation techniques such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Risk Adaptive Access Control (RAdAC). The DoD&#39;s net-centric information sharing environment, and evolution towards increased interoperability with other federal agencies and coalition partners, requires applications and systems to evolve their current authentication, authorization, and access control paradigms to support both anticipated and unanticipated users.
